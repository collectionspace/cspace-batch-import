= Managing mappers

Requirements:

- You must have admin permissions in `cspace-batch-import`
- You must be able to update the `mappers.json` file in AWS `cs-public-shared-files` bucket


Context/background:

Mappers are generated using https://github.com/collectionspace/cspace-config-untangler[`cspace-config-untangler`].

Mappers are created from the JSON CollectionSpace application config available at a URL following the pattern:

`https://core.collectionspace.org/cspace/core/config`

`cspace-config-untangler` can also generate a `mappers.json` file.

Steps:

- Update the mappers.json file (i.e. the manifest).
- Validate the file after your updates
- Upload the new file to the `cs-public-shared-files` bucket (When on the file listing for the bucket, drag the file from your desktop to the file list. Or use CLI)
- In base of `cspace-batch-import` directory, do the following to open the app in the console:

`./bin/rails c`

- Once in console:

`Mapper.refresh`
`Mapper.clean_up`
